- PICK UP the `compass` from beside the globe
- return to the living room and USE the `horse figurine` on the pedestal between the door to the study and the door to the living room
  > You may USE the `compass` on the horse figurine at this point to determine the starting position of the horse and to further determine the four directions the horse can point:  
  > “into the screen” is *north*, “right” is *east*, “out of the screen” is *south*, and “left” is *west*)
- complete The Pedestal Puzzle

#### 1.2.1. *The Pedestal Puzzle*

- the objective is to rotate the horse in a particular sequence as if operating a dial-type combination lock, alternately turning the horse clockwise and counter-clockwise, so that it faces south, east, west and finally north.
- to complete this puzzle, USE the `horse figurine` and turn it without exiting the interaction:  
  3x clockwise, counter-clockwise, 2x clockwise, 3x counter-clockwise

#### 1.2.2. *End of The Pedestal Puzzle*

- EXAMINE the lit area of the wall
- USE the phone at the left-hand side of the room to phone Sara, ask her about the missing painting
- leave the estate and go to the gallery

### 1.3. The Art Gallery

- USE the red rope visible next to the silhouette of the urn at the far right-hand side of the room

- USE the `paper knife` with behind painting to collect Chapter I
- start reading

### 1.4. Chapter I

- go to the cove (the path is next to the lighthouse)

- USE the `dagger` on the rope mooring the small boat

  > Thanks to bigh for catching this omission

- **quickly** USE the `water flask` on yourself and then either wait or USE the `bowl` on the dragon
  > The Logic:  
    Firstly, Semita would only ever give you poison which you cannot neutralise. Since you have no access to well 3 then Semita can either give you water from well 2 or water from well 3. The only way to survive this is to ensure that the water offered is an antitoxin instead which you can do by poisoning yourself just before the exchange. Secondly, The only way to ensure Semita is fatally poisoned is to administer a poison she cannot neutralise. Since Semita has access to well 3 and expects you to give her water from either well 1 or well 2 then instead you should give her drinking water and allow her to poison herself.

#### 1.4.2. *End of The Well Hierarchy Puzzle*

- PICK UP the `shed skin` (next to the nest), the `brimstone crystal` (from the fire pit) and the `shiny horn` (visible towards the back of the cave)

#### 3.8.1. *The Calendar Riddle*

- the puzzle is solved by inputting  
  **7,4,12,8 (VII, IV, XII, VIII)**

> The Logic:  
> The combination for the bunker is on the front cover of the calendar which is found in the cabin. Each stanza expresses a single number and the order in which they are read as well as the first word of each stanza indicate that number's position in the combination. The first stanza relates to “wonders of the world” of which it is popularly said there were 7. The second relates to the horsemen in the book of revelation of which there were 4. The third relates to the labours of Hercules of which there were 12. The final stanza indicates a full octave (“missing no note, losing no key”) and so 8.
