## 1. General

When you talk to a character, always talk about everything. For some characters, you have to talk to them several times until you are able to select all dialogue options. The solution only provides important dialogue options, required to solve specific puzzles.

Actions on inventory items are written as `Inline Code`. Each time you see `this code`, you have to select or do an action on the inventory object. When you get new inventory items, these are appended to the corresponding action line in brackets (`New item`).
