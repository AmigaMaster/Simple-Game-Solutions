    I sought the plow, I had no guide,

    Beginning from Enebro Square,
    I wandered ever eastward,
    I strolled until I found the street,
    Named for a noisy seabird.
    I made a right, and headed south,
    I knew that I was near,
    My destination nudged between,
    A chapel and a pier.
    Upon the door there thrice I knocked,
    And stated then my purpose,
    The Masters' Portal opened wide,
    Long may they ever serve us!
